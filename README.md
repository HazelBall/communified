# communified
CommUnified is an unfinished Web app for translating languages in multilingual classroom settings. This project was going to be a fully fledged app, but ended up turning into more of a project on web apps themselves, and learning how to use firebase. It was not fun, and that's really why I didn't finish it.
If you are really interested in this, go ahead an fork it. I will not be updating it any time soon which is why it is archived.



Thanks
